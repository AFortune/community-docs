  <h1>Bite! Clojure</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome! This web site has a lot of (should be in near future) documents
    for the ClojureBridge event. The documents will be used as a
    supportive material. ClojureBridge has a main stream
    document (on going now); however, only one document would be
    unable to fit/satisfy all attendees of the events. Some might be
    programmers of other languages, some may be designers, or others
    are, probably, beginners of programming.
    For attendees of various backgounds, providing extra
    labs and explanations is a purpose of the documents here.
    So that everybody can cheerfully "Bite! Clojure".
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    The documents assume that the attendees will try lab problems with
    helps of coaches. Each document has advices to the coaches
    also(should be there). If you will volunteer as a coach, have a look at the advices
    to know what the attendees should learn.

    <b>Help Wanted!! GIVE US PULL REQUEST!</b><br/>
    Yes, we really want helps from Clojure community. It is very hard
    for one or two people to write documents to cover a computer
    language.
    Gratefully, at the unsession of Clojure/Conj, also, ClojureBridge
    mailing list, we have gotten so many ideas and voices of "I can
    help". What an awesome community!
    If we can get your help to grow the documents here, that will be
    SUPER AWESOME!!
    <br/>
    <b>Fork the repo, write a document, and give us a pull request!</b>
    We will merge your document, which will be a material at
    ClojureBridge events. <a href="#">How to Contribute</a> guides you
    how to write.
