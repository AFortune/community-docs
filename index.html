  <h1>Bite! Clojure</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to <a href="www.clojurebridge.org">ClojureBridge</a>
    CommunityDocs! This web site has a lot of (should be in near future)
    documents for the ClojureBridge workshops. The documents will be used
    as a supportive material. ClojureBridge has a main stream document
    (on going now
    at <a href="https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum">https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum</a>);
    however, only one document would be unable to fit/satisfy all
    attendees of the workshops. Some might be programmers of other
    languages, some may be designers, or others are, probably,
    beginners of programming. For such attendees of various backgounds,
    providing extra labs and explanations (by coaches) is a purpose of the
    documents here. So that everybody can enjoy "Bite! Clojure".
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    The documents assume that the attendees will try lab problems with
    helps of coaches. Each document has advices to the coaches
    also(should be there). If you will volunteer as a coach, have a look at the advices
    to know what the attendees should learn.

    <b>Help Wanted!! GIVE US PULL REQUEST!</b><br/>
    Yes, we really want helps from <b>you</b>. Clearly,
    it is very hard for just one or two people to write documents to cover whole lot of Clojure.
    Fortunately, at the unsession of Clojure/Conj, also, on ClojureBridge
    mailing list, we have gotten so many ideas and voices of "I can
    help". Awesome!
    If we can get your help to complete the documents here, that will be
    SUPER AWESOME!!
    <br/>
    Please <b>Fork the repo, write a document, and give us a pull request!</b>
    We will merge your work, which will be a part of materials at
    ClojureBridge workshops. Please read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/contribute">
    How to Contribute</a>, which guides you how to write a document.
